                <h2>milk rice</h2>
                <p> One of the tastiest breakfast dishes in Sri Lanka is milk rice.
                    A bit like a savoury rice pudding, kiribath is made by boiling white 
                   or brown kakulu rice (a type of Sri Lankan rice) with water and coconut 
                   milk until it becomes glutinous and sticky. It’s pressed into a tray and 
                   cooled, then sliced into squares and served with 
                   a chilli and onion sambol, called Lunu Miris. Want to enjoy it the way the
                    locals do? Ann recommends trying it with spicy chicken or fish curry.      
                </p>
                <p class="pri">
                    $9.00

            <div class="box box4">
                <h2>hoppers</h2>
                <p>When it comes to Sri Lankan must eats, hoppers are at the top of the 
                    list for almost all food-loving travellers. A batter of rice flour and
                     coconut milk is poured into a bowl-shaped hopper pan, which allows a 
                    crispy thin outer layer and a slightly thicker centre. Now comes the 
                    fun yum part: loading up your hopper with accompaniments. Have it with an 
                    egg, curry and sambol, or with treacle and banana for a sweet treat.

                <h2>string hoppers</h2>
                <p>Another (very yummy) breakfast staple is string hoppers. A soft dough 
                    is made by mixing together rice flour and water, which is placed into a 
                    string hopper press and squeezed onto mats to make the noodle-like string 
                    hoppers. The long stringy noodles are steamed until voila, you’ve got a 
                    small mound of string hoppers.

                <h2>sri Lankan pancakes</h2>
                <p>ou’ve probably gathered by now that most Sri Lankan breakfasts pack a pretty spicy 
                    little punch, but this one’s perfect for the sweet-toothed traveller. A batter made from 
                    wheat flour, coconut milk, egg and turmeric is poured onto a hot pan and topped with fresh 
                    grated coconut, jaggery (a type of cane sugar) and spices. The pancake is then rolled into
                     a neat little parcel, and is best enjoyed with a hot cup of tea.

                <h2>Mung kiribath</h2>
                <p>Mung kiribath is the same as normal kiribath, but with mung beans. There’s a perfect balance 

                    of mung beans and kekulu 
                    rice in it. For me, I prefer mung kiribath more. Because of the taste mung beans bring,
                     it’s best devoured with spicy lunu miris or katta sambol.

                <h2>pol roti</h2>
                <p>Another much-loved breakfast dish in Sri Lanka, pol roti is made with flour and grated 
                    coconut flakes. The flat roti is best enjoyed when they are just off the pan, hot and crispy. 
                    Nathan and I both love ours spicy, with
                     a beautiful chicken curry oozing with oil and lunu miris. My father, however, prefers his 
                    roti sweet and enjoys them with sugar or seeni sambol.

                <h2>paan (or bread)</h2>
                <p>In Sri Lanka, we have paan (or bread) for breakfast, like many other countries. 
                    But we don’t often toast it. We take slices of bread, usually bought from small bakeries,
                     namely kade paan or roast paan and eat them with a curry or pol sambol. As always, 
                    chicken curry is favorite. But it’s common to spot paan with a thick lentils curry or a 
                    potato curry. I enjoy mine with a tempered potato fry too.

                <h2>Dosa</h2>
                <p>Dosa is a popular breakfast food in Sri Lanka prepared by the Tamil community. 
                    I remember when I was young, my father bought them from the nearby shop for breakfast. 
                    Dosa is made with fermented batter, which is made with rice flour and black gram flour.
                     Sri Lankan dosa, usually Jaffna style dosa, is different to the South Indian dosa.

                <p> sprat fry with coconut sambol or boiled or fried egg is very popular with morning rice.
                    There’s white rice as well. Sometimes, a simple, mildly-spiced lentils curry with dry fish fry and coconut sambol make 
                   for a sublime breakfast.
